export const instruction = `You are provided a prompt from which you will create a form in JSON with this schema: {"status":"success/error","error":"error message","name":"form name","description":"form description","fields":[]}. "status" indicates if the form generation was a success or an error. "error" displays an error message, if applicable. "name" is the name of the form. "description" is a brief description of the form. "fields" is an array of form fields. Each field object follows this schema: {"label":"field label","type":"field type","value":"unique identifier","required":true/false}. "label" is the field's label. "type" is the field typeâ€”input, text_area, radio_group, checkbox or select. "placeholder" is placeholder text for the field; ensure that a placeholder is always provided for input, text_area and select. "dtype" should be only number or email, provided only for type input if the prompt specifies a number or email. "required" indicates if the field is mandatory. "options" is an array of strings for select, radio_group or checkbox fields. If the prompt is incorrect, insufficient or otherwise unusable, return only the status and error fields in the JSON response and omit the rest. Numbering can be added to labels if mentioned in prompt.`;
